процесс преобразования значений нескольких переменных в одинаковый диапазон. \n","\n","Типичная нормализация включает масштабирование переменной так, чтобы среднее значение переменной было равно 0, \n","масштабирование переменной так, чтобы дисперсия была равна 1, или масштабирование переменной так, чтобы значения переменной варьировались от 0 до 1.\n","Нормализация данных - это процесс приведения значений признаков в диапазон от 0 до 1 или от -1 до 1. Это может быть полезно для улучшения производительности алгоритмов машинного обучения, так как многие алгоритмы работают лучше, когда данные находятся в одном диапазоне.\n","\n","Существует несколько методов нормализации данных, вот некоторые из них:\n","\n","1. Min-Max нормализация: этот метод приводит значения признаков в диапазон от 0 до 1. Формула для Min-Max нормализации:\n","\n","   \n","   x_norm = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)\n","   \n","\n","   Где x - исходное значение признака, x_min - минимальное значение признака, x_max - максимальное значение признака.\n","\n","2. Z-нормализация: этот метод приводит значения признаков к стандартному нормальному распределению со средним значением 0 и стандартным отклонением 1. Формула для Z-нормализации:\n","\n","   \n","   x_norm = (x - mean) / std\n","   \n","\n","   Где x - исходное значение признака, mean - среднее значение признака, std - стандартное отклонение признака.\n","\n","3. Логарифмическая нормализация: этот метод применяется к данным, которые имеют большой разброс значений. Он применяет логарифмическую функцию к данным, чтобы уменьшить разброс значений.\n","\n","Какой метод нормализации использовать, зависит от данных и задачи. Min-Max нормализация хорошо работает для данных, которые имеют равномерное распределение, а Z-нормализация - для данных, которые имеют нормальное распределение. Логарифмическая нормализация может быть полезна для данных, которые имеют большой разброс значений.\n","\n","Важно также помнить, что нормализация данных может быть не всегда необходима. Например, для деревьев решений и некоторых других алгоритмов машинного обучения нормализация не требуется.\n","\n","</p>\n","\n","<b>Пример</b>\n","<p>Чтобы продемонстрировать нормализацию, допустим, мы хотим масштабировать столбцы \"длина\", \"ширина\" и \"высота\".</p>\n","<p><b>Цель:</b> хотелось бы нормализовать эти переменные, чтобы их значение было в диапазоне от 0 до 1</p>\n","<p><b>Задача:</b> заменить исходное значение на (исходное значение)/(максимальное значение)</p>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":378,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# заменить исходное значение на (исходное значение)/(максимальное значение) по этому столбцу\n","df['length'] = df['length']/df['length'].max()\n","df['width'] = df['width']/df['width'].max()\n","df['height'] = df['height']/df['height'].max() "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":379,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>length</th>\n","      <th>width</th>\n","      <th>height</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0.811148</td>\n","      <td>0.890278</td>\n","      <td>0.816054</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0.811148</td>\n","      <td>0.890278</td>\n","      <td>0.816054</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>0.822681</td>\n","      <td>0.909722</td>\n","      <td>0.876254</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>0.848630</td>\n","      <td>0.919444</td>\n","      <td>0.908027</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>0.848630</td>\n","      <td>0.922222</td>\n","      <td>0.908027</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["     length     width    height\n","0  0.811148  0.890278  0.816054\n","1  0.811148  0.890278  0.816054\n","2  0.822681  0.909722  0.876254\n","3  0.848630  0.919444  0.908027\n","4  0.848630  0.922222  0.908027"]},"execution_count":379,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# проверить результаты\n","df[[\"length\",\"width\",\"height\"]].head()"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Здесь видно, что мы нормализовали \"длину\", \"ширину\" и \"высоту\" в диапазоне [0,1].\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h2 id=\"binning\">Биннинг</h2>\n","Бинирование -
